This project involves implementing Google's <model-viewer> library to seamlessly integrate 3D model viewing capabilities into web applications. The integration enables users to interact with 3D assets, including zooming, rotating, and viewing in augmented reality (AR). Designed for efficiency and compatibility, the implementation leverages modern web standards like WebGL and <model-viewer> attributes to ensure responsiveness and high performance across devices.

The project is ideal for applications requiring rich, interactive 3D experiences, such as e-commerce product visualization, education, or AR-based demonstrations.
